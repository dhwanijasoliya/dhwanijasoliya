I‚Äôm an enthusiastic **MSc. Data Science** student, actively working on my **thesis** while gaining real-world experience as a **Part-Time Data Scientist** at KUGU Homes. I love exploring the intersection of **machine learning** and **data-driven solutions** to solve real-world problems.

üí° **Fun Fact**: When I‚Äôm not wrangling data, you‚Äôll find me exploring nature üå≤.

## üöÄ Projects

### 1. [Stock Market Kafka Real-Time Data Engineering Project](https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-kafka-project)  
This project was all about building a **real-time data pipeline** for stock market data using **Apache Kafka** and several key **AWS services** like **S3**, **Athena**, and **Glue**.

The focus was on managing the **entire data engineering lifecycle**‚Äîfrom ingesting data in real time, storing it in the cloud, processing it, and finally making it available for querying. It's a great example of handling **streaming data** in a scalable, cloud-native architecture.

**Technologies Used**:  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Cloud & Data Services**: AWS (S3, Athena, Glue, EC2)  
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Kafka

### 2. [Plant Disease Classification with CNN](https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-classification)  
In this project, I built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify plant diseases using the **PlantVillage Dataset**. The model achieved an accuracy of **83.3%**. 

I used **data augmentation** and **image preprocessing** to improve model generalization, applying techniques like random flips and rotations. The architecture features multiple **Conv2D layers** followed by **MaxPooling**, and the final classification is done using **Dense layers** with **softmax activation**. The whole model was built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

**Technologies Used**:  
- **Machine Learning Framework**: TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Key Concepts**: Data augmentation, CNN architecture, image preprocessing

### 3. [PowerBI Dashboard for Business Insights](https://github.com/yourusername/powerbi-dashboard)  
This project was about creating powerful and insightful **Power BI dashboards** for different business audiences‚Äî**Finance**, **Sales**, **Marketing**, and **C-level Executives**.

I began by extracting data into **MySQL** and modeling it using a **snowflake schema**. Then, the data was imported into **Power BI**, where I performed data cleaning, modeling, and created calculated measures using **DAX** formulas. A key challenge here was optimizing the dashboard layout for different screen sizes and incorporating feedback during **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**.

The project ended with deploying the dashboards through the **Power BI Web Service** and integrating a dynamic navigation bar for ease of use.

**Technologies Used**:  
- **BI Tools**: Power BI, DAX  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Data Processing**: Excel, Power Query, M Language  
- **Key Skills**: Data wrangling, data modeling, report optimization

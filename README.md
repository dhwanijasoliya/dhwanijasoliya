I‚Äôm an enthusiastic **MSc. Data Science** student, actively working on my **thesis** while gaining real-world experience as a **Part-Time Data Scientist** at KUGU Homes. I love exploring the intersection of **machine learning** and **data-driven solutions** to solve real-world problems.

üí° **Fun Fact**: When I‚Äôm not wrangling data, you‚Äôll find me exploring nature üå≤.

## üöÄ Projects

### 1. [Stock Market Kafka Real-Time Data Engineering Project](https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-kafka-project)  
The objective of this project was to combine **Apache Kafka** and important **AWS services** like S3, Athena, Glue, and others to create a real-time data pipeline for the stock market.

The management of the whole data engineering lifecycle‚Äîincluding real-time data consume, cloud storage, processing, and query availability‚Äîwas the main topic of this portion. 

**Technologies Used**:  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Cloud & Data Services**: AWS (S3, Athena, Glue, EC2)  
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Kafka

### 2. [Plant Disease Classification with CNN](https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-classification)  
In order to categorize plant illnesses, I constructed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in this experiment utilizing the Plant¬†Dataset. The accuracy of the model was **83.3%**. 

I used **data augmentation** and **image preprocessing** to improve model generalization, applying techniques like random flips and rotations. The architecture features multiple **Conv2D layers** followed by **MaxPooling**, and the final classification is done using **Dense layers** with **softmax activation**. The whole model was built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

**Technologies Used**:  
- **Machine Learning Framework**: TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Key Concepts**: Data augmentation, CNN architecture, image preprocessing

### 3. [PowerBI Dashboard for Business Insights](https://github.com/yourusername/powerbi-dashboard)  
This project was about creating powerful and insightful **Power BI dashboards** for different business audiences‚Äî**Finance**, **Sales**, **Marketing**, and **C-level Executives**.

I began by extracting data into **MySQL** and modeling it using a **snowflake schema**. Then, the data was imported into **Power BI**, where I performed data cleaning, modeling, and created calculated measures using **DAX** formulas. A key challenge here was optimizing the dashboard layout for different screen sizes and incorporating feedback during **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**.

The project ended with deploying the dashboards through the **Power BI Web Service** and integrating a dynamic navigation bar for ease of use.

**Technologies Used**:  
- **BI Tools**: Power BI, DAX  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Data Processing**: Excel, Power Query, M Language  
- **Key Skills**: Data wrangling, data modeling, report optimization
